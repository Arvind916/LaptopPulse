# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a Laptop Price Prediction Project, where we leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of laptops based on various features. The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can assist buyers and sellers in estimating laptop prices accurately.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of various features of laptops such as brand, processor, RAM, storage capacity, screen size, graphics card, etc., along with their corresponding prices. The data has been collected from various online sources and curated for training our machine learning models.

# Project Workflow
* Data Collection: Acquire the laptop data from reliable sources or use a publicly available dataset.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical features, and perform feature scaling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the distribution of features, visualize correlations, and gain insights into the dataset.
* Feature Engineering: Select relevant features, create new features if needed, and prepare the data for training.
* Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the regression task (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
* Model Training: Train the selected models on the preprocessed data and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R-squared) and compare their performance.
* Price Prediction: Deploy the best-performing model to predict laptop prices for new unseen data.
* Usage Example: Provide a simple example of how to use the model for price prediction in a Python script or Jupyter notebook.
