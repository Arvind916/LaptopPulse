# Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a Laptop Price Prediction Project, where we leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of laptops based on various features. The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can assist buyers and sellers in estimating laptop prices accurately.

# Project Structure
`data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
`notebooks`/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
`src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation.
`models/`: Saved model files after training.
`requirements.txt`: List of required libraries and dependencies.
